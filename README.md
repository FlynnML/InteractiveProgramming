# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2018 at Olin College.

The only package required to run this code is pygame.
Pygame can be installed as such:

$ apt-get build-dep python-pygame

$ apt-get install mercurial python-dev python-numpy ffmpeg libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libsdl1.2-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev

$ pip install pygame

and everything from .locals should be imported.

The final project is named ultimatettt.py, and should be run from the command line with:

$ python ultimatettt.py

wherein a pygame window displaying a blank Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe board will appear, ready to for interaction.
